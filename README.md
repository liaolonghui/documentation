Alpaca Finance is the largest lending protocol allowing leveraged yield farming on Binance Smart Chain. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields, and offers borrowers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions, vastly multiplying their farming principals and resulting profits.â€Œ

As an enabler for the entire DeFi ecosystem, Alpaca amplifies the liquidity layer of integrated exchanges, improving their capital efficiency by connecting LP borrowers and lenders. It's through this empowering function that Alpaca has become a fundamental building block within DeFi, helping bring the power of finance to each and every person's fingertips, and every alpaca's paw...

Furthermore, alpacas are a virtuous breed. Thatâ€™s why, we are a fair-launch project with no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. So from the beginning, this has always been a product built by the people, for the people. Or as we like to say: **by the alpacas, for the alpacas.**

### What is yield farming?
Yield farming is an innovative DeFi concept where users stake or lend their crypto assets in order to receive returns.

### Why did we build Alpaca Finance?
Pioneered by Compound during the DeFi Summer, yield farming on Ethereum has become a widespread method for projects to bootstrap their liquidity and acquire new users. However, as of late, the rising costs of the process have become more and more prohibitive for the majority of people. In fact, Ethereum has become a whale game because the gas fees are just too damn high!

As a result, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has experienced an exponential boom in popularity, and in this emerging ecosystem, we noticed a gap amongst the applications offered there compared to other chains such as Ethereum. To be specific, one of the largest missing pieces--was an on-chain leverage protocol! 

Thus, Alpaca Finance was born, seeking to provide value to the BSC community through leveraged yield farming.
