# ðŸŒ¿ Grazing Range
The Grazing Range: a magical place where Alpacas can graze on rare crops of their choice.

On the [Graze](www.baidu.com) page, each of you Alpacas will be able to select which token rewards you wish to graze on and **stake ibALPACA to receive those rewards.** In addition, if you stake a minimum 500/5000/50,000 (three tiers) of ibALPACA in a pool from its inception to its end (typically 4 weeks), you will receive something special â€” an exclusive Alpaca NFT. You can follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlpacaFinance) to learn when new Grazing Range pools open.
