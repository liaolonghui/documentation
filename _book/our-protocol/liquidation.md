# ðŸŒŠ Liquidation

***

Today, weâ€™ll take a closer look into liquidation, demystifying the concept to make it simpler to understand. But first, letâ€™s recap a few terms that will be used in the next section:

- Your **Debt Value** is the value of the borrowed tokens
- Your **Position Value** is the value of your farming position, which is equal to your collateral + borrowed assets + yields (also known as the value of your LP tokens) 
- The **Debt Ratio** is your Debt Value divided by the Position Value
- Your **Equity Value** is your **Position Value** minus your **Debt Value**
(All values above are displayed in the borrowed token)
