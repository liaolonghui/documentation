### Risks to Lenders

#### Loss of Capital:

* Risk: the risk of debt accrued by underwater positions in case liquidators do not liquidate in time during a period of high market volatility.
* Mitigation: we have taken a cautious approach in setting key parameters to ensure a large buffer. We also have provided enough incentive to liquidators to call and liquidate applicable positions. Hence, we believe this risk scenario is very unlikely to occur.
