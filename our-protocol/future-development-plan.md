# 🗺️ Roadmap
The sky is (not) the limit!
***  
Below, you’ll find Alpaca’s roadmap, but first, we’ll share with you our high-level goals for Alpaca Finance in 2021:
1. Establish the most comprehensive and advanced leveraged yield farming ecosystem with highly-composable features, integrating with the top AMMs and protocols across BSC.   
2. Increase the ALPACA token’s long-term value and utility within our ecosystem through additional deflationary mechanisms and protocol use-cases, as well as across the DeFi-space through accelerating marketing and business development activities (partnerships, cross-platform lending, CEX listings, etc).   
3. Optimize protocol security and robustness through audits and the addition of multi-sig.   
4. Implement NFT campaigns leveraging Alpaca’s unique branding, and integrate those NFTs with platform features that improve engagement, deliver genuine utility, and offer increased yields.
5. Establish Alpaca Finance as a foundational layer in the DeFi landscape through horizontal and vertical protocol integrations, unmatched composability and leverage offerings, and cross-chain expansions.

### Q1 2021:
✔️ Fair Launch ALPACA token

✔️ BUSD and BNB single-asset staking vaults

✔️ ALPACA/wBNB PancakeSwap LP staking vault

✔️ Stronk Vault and sALPACA(experimental synthetic with futures+bond elements)

✔️ Complete Audits with PeckShield and Certik

✔️ Launch Leveraged Yield Farming with new auto-compounding pools, providing leverage on popular PancakeSwap pools

✔️ Token Value Expansion — add buyback and burn mechanisms to make ALPACA long-term deflationary (more explained below)

✔️ Launch Liquidation Bot (Although liquidation will still be possible for external parties to avoid centralization and single point of failure, we’ll have an in-house liquidation bot that should be faster). 100% of the 5% liquidation fee will go towards ALPACA buyback and burn (first deflationary mechanism, implemented on LYF launch)

✔️ 50% of the 10% interest rate fee for borrowing/leveraged farming will be used on ALPACA buyback and burn. This means half of the leveraged farming fees will go towards token holders in the form of burn (second deflationary mechanism, implemented on LYF launch)
