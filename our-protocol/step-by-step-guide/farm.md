  - You may supply any combination of the two assets in the farming pair. Our smart contract optimally converts your deposited assets and the borrowed assets to get an equal value-split to supply the farming liquidity pool.
* Select your desired leverage. Each pool has a distinct maximum leverage level.
* Select the asset you wish to borrow. (For farming pools where we have deposit vaults for both assets, you will be able to select which asset you wish to borrow.)
